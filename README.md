# Bowling Challenge in JavaScript

This is Alexis Morcrette's partial solution to the Bowling Challenge in JavaScript, Makers Academy's Week 6 Weekend Challenge.

The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code in JavaScript and Node.js, a language that we have only been learning for one week, and to deliver a bowling score program.

This challenge builds on last week's challenge, which was to write a similar program in Ruby. You can visit this project [here](https://github.com/almorcrette/bowling-challenge-ruby).

This project demonstrates the following skills:
* A coherent process to learn a new language
* Using diagramming to plan my approach to the challenge
* TDD my code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Committing often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/almorcrette/bowling-challenge-js`

`command_to_install_dependencies`

## Usage

`command_to_start`
Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`


## Running tests

`jest`

## File manifest

----------------------------------------------

At the barest minimum, it should contain a description of what the code does, how to install it, how to use it and how to run its tests. In addition, READMEs often include other information such as:

- Configuration instructions
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
- A news section (usually for users)
